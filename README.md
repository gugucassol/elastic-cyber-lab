# Elastic Cyber Lab

This project is an ongoing cybersecurity lab focused on deploying and configuring the Elastic Stack in a self-hosted environment. It simulates real-world threat detection scenarios with secure communication and centralized monitoring.

---

## Project Overview

- Deployed **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet Server) on **Ubuntu 24.04**.
- Manually configured a **TLS-secured Fleet Server** using a custom **Certificate Authority (CA)** and OpenSSL.
- Successfully enrolled an **Elastic Agent on Windows Server 2019**.
- Real-time monitoring via Kibana, enabling endpoint visibility and data ingestion.
